# AmazonRedirect

You may have been redirected here from az.sub-etha.link.

This is the AWS Lambda code that does the redirection based on the user's location.

If you want to use it, please make your own, with your own ASINs. Lambda functions aren't free, and while this doesn't cost me anything for the clicks I get, I might find myself with a big bill if everyone started using it.
